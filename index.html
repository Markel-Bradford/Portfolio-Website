        <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am an innovative and detail oriented professional located in
          Huntsville, Alabama that is working to transition from management into
          the world of front-end development. I currently have experience with
          HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently attending American Military Univeristy pursuing my
          Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology with a concentration
          in Multitier Architecture. I am looking to continue to develop my
          knowledge and skills in development through continued education and am
          expecting to graduate early 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I work for the 3rd party quality company Stratosphere
          Quality as a Site Operations Manager responsible for 100+ employees. I
          am currently open to and seeking internships and entry level web
          development job opportunities.

        <p>
          My task for this project was to build a functional survey form using
          HTML and a CSS style sheet. This was a FreeCodeCamp project and I
          decided to go with a survey that targeted FreeCodeCamp users to
          collect feedback on their desired rolls as a developer, their skills,
          and their experience. Entries can be entered into all fields on the
          form and it can be submitted once completed.

            alt="Masahiro Sakurai Tribute Page"
          />
        </a>
        <p>
          The objective for this project was to build a tribute page dedicated
          to someone important to you using HTML and a CSS style sheet. The
          focus was building an informative website with a timeline of impactful
          events that happened in the persons life and career. I chose Masahiro
          Sakurai because he developed my all time favorite game,
          <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>, for the Nintendo Gamecube.
