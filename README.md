# Portfolio Website
This was my first attempt at a developer portfolio website. To create it, I used basic HTML and CSS, along with media queries
to make the portfolio accesible on different devices. This was a fun project that helped me learn how to build my current portfolio I create using ReactJS.

Please feel free to take a look at my code. Thanks!
